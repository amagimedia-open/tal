                            --------
        This document seeks propose a model for transactions based 
        on the document 'some_thoughts_on_training.txt version 0.21'.

                            -----------

    (A) What do we want ?

        The document 'some_thoughts_on_training.txt version 0.21'
        presented a mechanism by which component interactions can
        be captured and visualized for the purposes of training.

        This document presents certain nuances relating to component 
        interaction constrained to the scope of training. Visualization
        is not covered here.


    (B) What are we interested in ?

        Restating 'some_thoughts_on_training.txt version 0.21':

        (a) We are interested when 

            (1) Two components interact through an interface. An interface
                that is provided by one component and exercised by another.
                Particularly when one component invokes a specific function 
                of the interface of another.

            (2) When a component 'announces' the occurance of an event to 
                other 'subscribing' components (perhaps through an event bus).

        (b) We are interested in the causality of interactions. i.e. which
            interaction/event caused another interaction/event to occur 
            (effect). As a generalization, we are interested in the causality
            tree.


    (C) What is the transactional model ?

        The transactional model is a data model intended to capture component
        interactions at a basic level.


    (D) Who is the audience ?

        (a) People who need an overview of components in amagi's broadcast 
            solution.

        (b) Operational L2 support.
            It is not in the purview of this document to cover L3 support
            that requires elaborate details of each interaction.
