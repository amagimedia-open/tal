                        +-------------+


    (A) What do we want ?

        The document 'some_thoughts_on_training.txt version 0.21'
        presented a mechanism by which component interactions can
        be captured and visualized for the purposes of training.

        This document extends this by presenting certain nuances 
        relating to component interactions (constrained to the scope 
        of training). Visualization is not covered here.


    (B) What are we interested in ?

        Restating 'some_thoughts_on_training.txt version 0.21':

        (a) We are interested when 

            (1) Two components interact through an interface. An interface
                that is provided by one component and exercised by another.
                Particularly when one component invokes a specific function 
                of the interface of another.

            (2) When a component 'announces' the occurance of an event to 
                other 'subscribing' component(s) (perhaps through an event 
                bus).

        (b) We are interested in the causality of interactions. i.e. which
            interaction/event caused another interaction/event to occur as
            an effect. As a generalization, we are interested in the causality
            tree.


    (C) What is the transactional model ?

        The transactional model is a data model intended to capture component
        interactions at a basic level.


    (D) Who is the audience ?

        (a) People who need an overview about components present in amagi's 
            broadcast solution.

        (b) Operational L2 support.
            This document does not cover L3 support that requires elaborate 
            details of each interaction.

                        | CONSIDERATIONS |
                        +----------------+


    In this section we will present the considerations that lead to 
    the definition of the transactional model.

    (A) What constitutes and interaction (transaction) ?

        (a) In a request-response scenario it is

            (1) The requestor component name
            (2) The responder component name
            (3) The function name (belonging to a specific interface)
            (4) An unique id that identifies the request
            (5) A 'parent' id that caused this request.

            Note that details of the function such as its parameters
            are not covered in this document.

        (b) In a event 'broadcast' model it is

            (1) The event-source component name
            (2) One or more event-sink component name(s)
            (3) The event name
            (4) An unique id that identifies the emission of the event
            (5) An 'parent' id that identifies the cause of emission of 
                the event

            Note that details of the event such as its attributes
            are not covered in this document.

    (B) Component name

        (a) Components take on one of the following roles for a given 
            interaction
            (1) requestor
            (2) responder
            (3) event-source 
            (4) event-sink

        (b) Component names must be unique that we may 
            (1) differentiate them from one another
            (2) differentiate between possibly multiple instances of
                the same component that are concurrently running
                on the same or different machines
            (3) differentiate between a newly created instance or
                a restored instance.


    (C) Function and event names

        (a) Every function name must be unique in a given interface.
            This assumes that every interface name must be unique.

        (b) Every event name must be unique.

        (c) As far as the model is concerned, it is not necessary to
            elucidate the actual function parameters of event attributes
            during an interaction.


    (D) Transaction identification

        (a) Every transaction must be uniquely identifiable.

        (b) A request and the corresponding response must possess the 
            same id.

        (c) Every transaction MUST have a causal/parent transaction.
            The only exceptions to this are
            (1) a request/event issued on a timer expiry 
            (2) a user initiated action


    (E) Versioning

        (a) The version of the model must be identifiable.

        (b) The versions of components/functions/events must
            be identifiable.

                        +---------------+


    (A) INSTANCES

        TODO


    (B) UID

        Unique ID. This could be a UUID, SHA-* hash, a running counter 
        within a namespace, etc..
        An UID is expected to be unique for a time duration that allows 
        for debugging of field issues. A period of at least 6 months if 
        not eternity.

        An UID

        (a) can be an opaque identifier to refer to a set of attributes 
            (typically name=value pairs) of an object.
            eg: 1622298779 referring to 
                {name={name}, started_at={datetime}..., ...)

        (b) can be a transparent identified that encodes the attributes
            in the UID itself.
            eg: {name}-1780198901-{datetime}

        (c) a combination of (a) and (b)
            eg: {name}-1780198901 refering to 
                {name={name}, started_at={datetime}..., ...)
