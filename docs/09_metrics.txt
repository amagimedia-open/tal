A. Metrics and Measurement
==========================

A software metric is a standard of measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property.[1][2] Even if a metric is not a measurement (metrics are functions, while measurements are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics), often the two terms are used as synonyms.

B. Metrics IS the system
========================

Now let us consider
    * a system
    * and properties about the system

We infer that 
    * A system is described using properties.
    * The system is different from its properties.

But without properties what is the system ?

An anology will help here:
    We can never know world. We only know it through conceptual words 
    (that we have invented). Therefore for all practical purposes 'word' 
    is the 'world'. If this is not the case then how can this world be
    described ? Any description surely is made up of words.

Properties or metrics describe a system. In fact the system is set of 
functions whose domain and range must be metrics.

Metric is not a measurement (metrics are functions, while measurements 
are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics). see section A.
