(A) logging as an interface

    (a) We respect this 

                                +---------------------------+
        Component-A ------------|-> (interface) Component-B |
                                +---------------------------+

    (b) We dont respect this 

                                  +---------------+                 
        Component-X   production  |  logging      |  comsumption   Component-A
        Component-Y  ------------>|  interface(s) | -------------> Component-B
        Component-Z               +---------------+                Component-C


(B) data model

    (a) We respect this and pay for them !
    
        AWS
        GoogleCloud
        MicrosoftAzure

    (b) We don't respect this

        Clear, simple data model driven by a common vocabulary at Amagi.


(C) standard vocabulary and interface

    (a) We respect this because they are paying us

        NBCU using BXF

    (b) But we dont imbue it at Amagi although its a standard

        Because we are heady and headstrong that we are a technology
        company using 50 different technological elements and such
        things are 'below our dignity'.
